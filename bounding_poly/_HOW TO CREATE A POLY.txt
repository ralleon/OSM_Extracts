HOW TO CREATE POLY FORMAT BOUNDARY in JOSM (with poly plugin):

1. load BOUNDARY_<iso>_<lgu>.osm to JOSM; delete any or ALL osm tags (key-value); 

2. Select all connected ways, then convert to a polygon using JOSM's:
   Tools>Combine-Way (or press C)
   Do this to every boundary-polygons and/or islands

3. Save the updated BOUNDARY_<iso>_<lgu>.osm for future use in Maperitive
	by customizing the shape of BOUNDARY_<iso>_<lgu>.osm 
	then saving it as "map_<iso>_<lgu>.poly" 
	to create ..\Maperitive\maps\map_<iso>_<lgu>.osm
   
4. File-Save-As poly format as: "extract_<iso>_<lgu>.poly"
