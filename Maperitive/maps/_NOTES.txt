MY NOTES (needs to be updated) 

SAMPLE DATA:
taytay_raw.osm	this can be easily downloaded from JOSM using Download > Slippy map, Bookmarks or "Area around places"

SAMPLE windows batch scripts:

__make_taytay_extract.bat			creates taytay_extract.osm (from taytay_raw.osm) (within administrative boundary)

_filter_taytay_covered_court.bat	extracts poi from taytay_extract.osm to create 3 output files:
									taytay_covered_court.csv (node only) Spreadsheet
									taytay_covered_court.kml (node only) Google Earth	
									update_my_covered_court.osm	(node & polygon) for JOSM updating/reuploading	

									
----------------------
POLY FORMAT
*.poly are bounding-polygons created using JOSM's poly plugin
How-to-make? remove all tags on your bounding polygon. "File save As" poly format. Done

Samples of poly formats used here: 
-make_taytay_extract.poly is a bounding-polygon that uses administrative boundary 
-make_taytay_map.poly is slightly larger than extract poly, for use in rendering towns in Maperitive.

===========================
MAPERITIVE DOESN'T WORK?! (OH I FORGOT HOW TO DO IT ...AGAIN :-) MY PANIC NOTES

Maperitive is looking for location of your personalized ruleset?

Try Listing all your Registered Rulesets:
	list-rulesets
	 eg.
	1: D:\Programs\Maperitive\Rules\Default.mrules (default)
	2: D:\Programs\Maperitive\Rules\Wireframe.mrules (wireframe)
	3: D:\Programs\Maperitive\Rules\GoogleMaps.mrules (googlemaps)
	4: Rules/MyOwn.mrules - ACTIVE
	Done

Switching Between Rulesets:::

	use-ruleset alias=googlemaps
	apply-ruleset


Assigning Aliases for Personalized Ruleset: (but this is not reliable for portable maperitive)
	
	use-ruleset location=Rules/MyOwn.mrules as-alias=myrules
	
	example:
	use-ruleset location=Rules/Default_PH.mrules as-alias=osmph

Changing Aliases - change the alias of your registered ruleset any time, example:

	use-ruleset index=4 as-alias=newalias

	NOTE:
	You can also reassign the alias from one ruleset to another using the same technique.
	You cannot use or change aliases for built-in rulesets. 
		eg. use-ruleset index=2 as-alias=osmph (will not work!)
TRICK to make Maperitive portable (and not look for that missing personalized msctipt: Reinstall it every time on default mscript.

When Making/Extracting Maps from philippines-latest.osm.pbf, 
wait for the osmconvert* temporary files to delete themselves from ..\maps\raw_osm   --->just to be sure :-)
